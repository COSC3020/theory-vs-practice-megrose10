# Theory vs. Practice

- List 3 reasons why asymptotic analysis may be misleading with respect to
  actual performance in practice.

- Suppose finding a particular element in a binary search tree with 1,000
  elements takes 5 seconds. Given what you know about the asymptotic complexity
  of search in a binary search tree, how long would you guess finding the same
  element in a search tree with 10,000 elements takes? Explain your reasoning.

- You measure the time with 10,000 elements and it takes 100 seconds! List 3
  reasons why this could be the case, given that reasoning with the asymptotic
  complexity suggests a different time.

Part 1:
1. Depending on the memory the machine has, or the program acquires, this can slow runtime.
2. If you have a more recursion based algorithm and a more iterative approach, these will have different runtimes so cannot be generalized.
3. Depending on the machines the code runs on, the same code can vary in time. Asymptotic analysis does not take in external variables.

Part 2:
Within binary trees, they usually have a complexity of log2(n). So, to find the estimated runtime we can find this by inputting our values. For 1000 elements the runtime is estimated at log2(1000) = 9.9 seconds. For 10000 elements, the runtime is estimated at log2(10000) = 13.3 seconds. This is just an estimation. To see how the logarithmic graph grows to these two points, we can divide them to see how much they grow, (13.3/9.9) = 1.34. So, now taking into account the runtime we are given for 1000 elements which is 5 seconds, we can multiply our rate that goes from 1000 to 10000 by the number resulting in 5 * 1.34 = 6.7 seconds. 

Part 3:
1. Depending on how far the element is down, and if the tree is very unbalanced so it resembles more of a linked list, this may make the runtime longer.
2. Depending on the type of data you use whether that is strings, integers, etc. the runtime may take longer. If the data is different data types it also may take longer. 
3. Depending on the computer you run your code on, with larger sets of data it may take longer to process through the binary tree.

I used lecture notes and slides to base my answers on. I wasn't fully sure if my formula was correct so I tried to search online to see what a binary search tree formula would be but resulted in trying to put log base 1000 in the calculator to check if the formula was right. I worked with Olivia, Ashlyn, and Cole(Nathanial). I was unsure on how to find the growth rate for question 2 on why the time was different from my guess of 9.9 seconds and the given time 5 seconds, so I asked chatGPT which showed me finding the ratio of the two runtimes finds the growth rate.
